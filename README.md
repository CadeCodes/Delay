# Delay

Delay is a extremely simple calculation tool to find the right delay for [MCSniperPY](https://github.com/MCsniperPY/MCsniperPY).
## Disclaimer
This program is still in heavy beta! Please do not rely on it for your exact delay. As the #info channel in the [MCSniperPY Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yp69ZqtxNk) states, there is no best delay based on ping and searches. You will still need to adjust it based on your request times and if they were late or early.
## Installation

Simply download delay.py and run it:
```bash
py delay.py
```

## Usage

Follow the prompts given by the program and it will calculate the delay for you.
